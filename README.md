# Circle_Clicker
Description: A game I made as a beginner's product when tinkering with **Corona SDK** (now **Solar 2D**).\
Game Summary: To gain points, tap the circles. Missing will reduce your accuracy and hurt your overall score.\
I'm keeping both the source code and the game build here if anyone wants to see how the game works and give any help.\
Any opinions/contribution is greatly appreciated.
